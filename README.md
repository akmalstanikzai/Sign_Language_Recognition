# Sign Language Recognition AI Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Sign Language Recognition AI project. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing and interpreting sign language gestures.

## Overview

Sign language is a crucial form of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to create a system that can interpret sign language gestures, enabling better communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: The AI model can recognize various sign language gestures captured through image or video input.
- **Real-time Recognition**: The system is designed to perform recognition in real-time, allowing for immediate interpretation of gestures.
- **Multi-Gesture Support**: The model supports recognition of multiple sign language gestures, facilitating a wider range of communication.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Other necessary libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akmalstanikzai/sign-language-recognition.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**

    Collect and organize a dataset of sign language gestures. Ensure proper labeling and separation into training, validation, and test sets.

4. **Training the Model**

    Use the provided scripts to train the AI model on the prepared dataset.

    ```bash
    python train.py --dataset <path_to_dataset>
    ```

5. **Testing and Evaluation**

    Evaluate the trained model's performance on test data or real-time input streams.

    ```bash
    python test.py --model <path_to_trained_model>
    ```

6. **Integration**

    Integrate the trained model into your application or use the provided inference scripts for real-time gesture recognition.
